Ill put the projects in order in this readme. I had more projects but my computers ssd died so i lost around 4 bigger projects.
I also included some game builds of some of the games, as one of them i dont have the updated project. and some are too big to fit all of the assets.
All networking in this portfolio was done by myself. Also the projects should work using any 2022 unity version.

These arent the best example of my abilities but, I can prove my skills if needed. I wish i had the rest of the projects to show.


Hello, Fruit - 2021.3.12f1: Second project i ever made, for a 14 day game jam. this was when i first started to really get into making games.

Prop Hunt - 2021.3.17f1: This was made alone and took about 30 days, my first multiplayer game using unity PUN2. It wasnt the best coding. but i learned a LOT about networking.  (The build in the Game Builds is the completed build but i couldnt find the finished project files.)

Caged2 2022.3.19f1: Prececessor to my original caged project i lost, I was in way over my head, but i made some neat scripts, and an inteligent AI. Also networked using PUN2 Had to delete alot of the project to fit it, but kept the scripts.

Were-In-Deep-Ship - 2022.3.26f1: This was a project i started in 2023, i juggled ideas around for a bit and ended up scrapping this, but again i made a lot of high level systems and managers. I think this shows off my improvement in networking code structure a bunch. Definetely had potential

High On Catnip - I lost the project files but its on my itch.io: Game i made in a game jam in 48 hours with a friend.

Bunker - 2022.3.34f1: Project im currently working on, i made a pretty detailed reverse building and excavating system. Been working on it for about 2 weeks, made with the new input system, and random terrain generation with procedural customizable bunkers. Its a WIP so its not pretty.

Tiny Sniper (aka SecretSuspects) - 2022.3.19f1: Made in 10 days in the 2024 LOWRESGAMEJAM, multiplayer social deduction game, i did some decent networking for being time limited. all done my be, a little art help from a friend.

Scary Atmosphere Test: I lost the project files but it was just really a test using unitys hdrp, and put together a feel i was going to go for in a project.

Larry : sculpt i did around a year ago, i have alot of fun sculpting too, aswell as rigging and modeling.
